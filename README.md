# Avengers

Are you willing to do what is necessary to win?
Can you avenge the fallen and come on top victoriously in a righteous sense of retribution?

Create your teams and decide how much firepower they will bring to the table. 
   
   -Each character will be placed on a team and you will have a choice to name what each squad will be called.
   -All your players will be given a name (by you) and they will all have certain abilities.
    -You will have a chance to name their skills and defense and determine how much firepower they will dish out against their enemies.
    -After you lay down the details of the battlefield, what each Hero or Villian can accomplish and how to properly name your team. THEN FIGHT!!
    
    -After the fight is said and done, you will be able to see the results of how your team did and whether or not they can fight again.
    
    PLAY IF YOU DARE!
